      Number of reads classified according to edition types.
      Reads are classified between WT (without an edit), template based modifications and indels.
      Indels are divided between deletions, insertions and delins (deletion + insertion).
      Deletions and insertions can be out of frame or in frame

      Number of reads classified between WT and containing indels.
      Both types are classified between passing the filtering steps or not.
      Indel reads passing the filtering steps are divided input:

        above the error rate but not in the edit region;
        below the error rate and within the edit region;
