## Introduction

**nf-core/crisprseq** is a bioinformatics best-practice analysis pipeline for the analysis of CRISPR edited data. It allows the evaluation of the quality of gene editing experiments using targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) data (`targeted`) as well as the discovery of important genes from knock-out or activation CRISPR-Cas9 screens using CRISPR pooled DNA (`screening`).

nf-core/crisprseq can be used to analyse:

- CRISPR gene knockouts (KO)
- CRISPR knock-ins (KI)
- Base editing (BE) and prime editing (PE) experiments
- CRISPR screening experiments (KO, CRISPRa (activation) or CRISPRi (interference))

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It uses Docker/Singularity containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible. The [Nextflow DSL2](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/dsl2.html) implementation of this pipeline uses one container per process which makes it much easier to maintain and update software dependencies. Where possible, these processes have been submitted to and installed from [nf-core/modules](https://github.com/nf-core/modules) in order to make them available to all nf-core pipelines, and to everyone within the Nextflow community!

On release, automated continuous integration tests run the pipeline on a full-sized dataset on the AWS cloud infrastructure. This ensures that the pipeline runs on AWS, has sensible resource allocation defaults set to run on real-world datasets, and permits the persistent storage of results to benchmark between pipeline releases and other analysis sources. The results obtained from the full-sized test can be viewed on the [nf-core website](https://nf-co.re/crisprseq/results).

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline) with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.

First, prepare a samplesheet with your input data that looks as follows:

`samplesheet.csv`:

```csv
sample,fastq_1,fastq_2,reference,protospacer,template
SAMPLE1,SAMPLE1_R1.fastq.gz,SAMPLE1_R2.fastq.gz,ACTG,ACTG,ACTG
```

or

`samplesheet.csv`:

```csv
sample,fastq_1,fastq_2,condition
SAMPLE1,SAMPLE1_R1.fastq.gz,SAMPLE1_R2.fastq.gz,control
```

For more details on how to build a sample sheet, please refer to the [usage documentation](https://nf-co.re/crisprseq/usage)

Now, you can run the pipeline using:

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/crisprseq --input samplesheet.csv --analysis <targeted/screening> --outdir <OUTDIR> -profile <docker/singularity/podman/shifter/charliecloud/conda/institute>
```

> [!WARNING]
> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_;
> see [docs](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration#custom-configuration-files).

For more details and further functionality, please refer to the [usage documentation](https://nf-co.re/crisprseq/usage) and the [parameter documentation](https://nf-co.re/crisprseq/parameters).
